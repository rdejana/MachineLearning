# Homework XX

## Overview
This Homework will compare image classificaiton inference performance with Tensorflow 1.15, Tensorflow 2, TFLite, and Jetson Inference.  Note, this is not currently containerized.

## Framework installation
### Prerequisites 
### Tensorflow 1.15
### Tensorflow 2.x
### TFLite
### Jetson Inference

## TBD
For each framework (Ryan note, provide TFLite exmample and a basic TF 1.15 one), you'll need to write a program that performs image classification with an image. The program should take arguments for the model, labels file, image, the number of times to run interence, the max number of classification results, and the classification score threshold. It then prints the model's prediction for what the image is to the terminal screen.
See the example for TFLite.

## Questions
1. What does it mean to quantize a model?
